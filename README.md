## Quick Start
To get started, it is highly recommended to check out the developer documentation [here](https://github.com/anthropology-inventory/docs/blob/main/frontend/frontend.md). If you just want to spin up a local instance of the frontend quickly, then first begin by cloning the latest version of the repository:

`https://github.com/anthropology-inventory/inventory.git`

In the project root, create the following file:

`.env.production`

Then add the following variable inside the file you just made:

`VITE_API_BASE_URI=https://api-849y.onrender.com`

After that, run `npm install` and then `npm run dev -- --mode production`
